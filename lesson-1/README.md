# Lesson 1

In this lesson we learned basics of blockchain. You can find the lesson content [here](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/dev-academy/intro).

Here is your assignment:

- [ ] Create a cosmwasm wallet and address. Save mnemonic somewhere safe. You will be using this address during 
  course.
- [ ] Request tokens to it on `pebble-1` network. We don't reveal information on how to request, in blockchain 
  finding information is a skill itself :)
- [ ] Find out transaction hash of token request. you can find it here
  https://block-explorer.pebblenet.cosmwasm.com/transactions. Use the search bar :)
- [ ] Post your address and faucet request transaction hash back to us by writing it in [assignment.json](assignment.json) 
  and pushing to your assignment repo. If all valid, assignment will be graded automatically.
